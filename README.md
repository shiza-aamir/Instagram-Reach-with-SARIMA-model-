# Instagram-Reach-with-SARIMA-model-
# Objective: 
Predict future Instagram reach based on historical data using SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).

# Steps:
 1.Data Import and Preprocessing:
 
    Load dataset, check for null values, and convert Date to datetime.
 2.Exploratory Data Analysis:
 
    Line chart for trend analysis.
    Bar chart for daily reach.
    Box plot for distribution and outlier detection.
 3.Weekly Analysis:
 
    Extract day of the week.
    Analyze and visualize reach per day.
 4.Time Series Decomposition:
 
    Decompose to observe trends, seasonality, and residuals.
 5.SARIMA Model:
 
    Fit SARIMA model with optimal parameters.
    Forecast next 30 days of reach.
 6.Visualization:
 
    Plot historical data and forecast.
    
This project aids in optimizing Instagram posting strategies by predicting future reach.
